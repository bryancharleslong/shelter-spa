# Welcome Virtual Pet Shelter!

This is a demonstration of a single page application to manage pets in cages. 
Try it out at https://pet-shelter-spa-frontend.herokuapp.com/
New pets can be added to any empty cage. New cages can be added and empty cages removed.

Featuring a Java REST API and front end application using Parcel.js and Node.js

My favorite feature is that cages are inserted or deleted alphabetically depending on already existing cages.
